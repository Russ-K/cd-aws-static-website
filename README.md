# Serverless Continuous Deploymeny Website builder

This repo contains a simple template for building a website auto deployment pipeline using the following AWS technologies:
* Code Pipeline
* Code Build
* Code Commit
* S3
* Route53
* and IAM roles and policies for the above

It assumes you've already bought the domain using Route53

I've also included a buildspec file in this repo to get you started with your build.
